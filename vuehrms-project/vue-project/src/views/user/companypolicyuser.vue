To submit a right to know, delete or opt-out (aka Do Not Sell My Information) request regarding Visitor Personal Information, click here, or call toll-free: (888) 213-4233. You may only make a verifiable customer request for access twice within a 12-month period.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless the request is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. Alternatively, we may decline to respond to the request and notify you of our reason for doing so.
